## Here are several documents, namely:

### My Drafts <br/>
Pieces of code for exercises and assessments, notes that I take during practical classes and other experiences using C language. It is an authentic disorganized notebook. <br>

### Notes
Notes that I take during theoretical lectures, in `.c` files or Markdown <br>

### Exercises
Varied exercises of easy, medium and difficult level, about the subject taught in the present week. They complement the weekly work developed during the practical classes. <br>

### Project

Pratical exercises done in group in three weeks. This project involved manipulating files, creating processes and strings comparation and modification based on system calls and standard C library. <br>
All questions can be consulted [here](/Project/Enunciado.pdf).
